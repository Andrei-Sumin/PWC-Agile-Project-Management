# Sicura Agile Digital Transformation

This repository contains a digital transformation strategy developed for **Sicura** motor insurance company. The project was developed as part of the **Agile Project Management** course at **Politecnico di Milano**, in collaboration with **PwC Italy**.

Our objective was to address Sicuraâ€™s core business challenges, including operational inefficiency and lack of online sales, by designing an AI-powered, customer-centric digital portal. The solution follows Agile methodology, from Epics and User Stories to MVP planning and sprint roadmapping.
