# Sicura Agile Digital Transformation

This repository contains a digital transformation strategy developed for **Sicura** motor insurance company. The project was developed as part of the **Agile Project Management** course at **Politecnico di Milano**, in collaboration with **PwC Italy**.

Our objective was to address Sicura’s core business challenges, including operational inefficiency and lack of online sales, by designing an AI-powered, customer-centric digital portal. The solution follows Agile methodology, from Epics and User Stories to MVP planning and sprint roadmapping.

## 🧾 Conclusion & Expected Impact

The proposed digital transformation for Sicura represents more than just a shift to online services. It redefines how the company interacts with customers, processes claims, and competes in an increasingly price-sensitive, convenience-driven market.

By implementing the AI-powered self-service portal, Sicura is positioned to:

- **Reduce operational costs**, particularly by automating claims processing and minimizing manual service interventions.
- **Expand its customer base**, reaching digital-native users and underserved regions through online channels and broker integrations.
- **Boost customer retention**, thanks to personalized policies, faster service, and transparent end-to-end digital experiences.
- **Improve key financial metrics**, including targeting a combined ratio below 100%, signaling long-term operational sustainability.

Through a carefully prioritized and sprint-driven Agile roadmap, the team ensured that each development phase delivers measurable value starting with an MVP that solves the company’s most urgent pain points, and gradually scaling toward full platform integration.

This transformation enables Sicura to become a modern, customer-first insurer: agile, data-driven, and ready to compete in a digital ecosystem.
